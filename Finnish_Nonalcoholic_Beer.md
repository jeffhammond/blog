# Jeff rates Finnish non-alcohoic beer

I do not consume ethanol, but I like beer.
These are my notes on this topic, from the perspective of a resident of Finland.

### [KOFF Crisp Vaalea Lager](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/products/koff/koff-crisp-vaalea-lager)

I like this one quite a bit.  There is enough hops flavor and the flavor palatte seems well-balanced.

### [More Brewing Lager](https://www.hartwall.fi/yritys/uutiset/2021/hartwallin-uusi-olutbrandi-more-brewing-on-alkoholittomana-syntynyt/)

This one is pretty good, but not as good as Crisp.
There is a lot of hops flavor in this one, but it seems like the beer is trying too hard to do this.
There are a lot of American alcoholic beers that try too hard to taste like hops, and if you like those beers, you will like this one.

### [Karjala](https://www.hartwall.fi/juomat/oluet/karjala/karjala-00/)

I do not like this one at all.
I do not understand what the creators were going for, but this is not a good beer.
There is not even a bad American beer -- e.g. Milwaukee's Best Ice -- that I can remember being worse.
