# Jeff rates Finnish non-alcoholic beer

I do not consume ethanol, but I like beer.
These are my notes on this topic, from the perspective of a resident of Finland.

### [KOFF Crisp Vaalea Lager](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/products/koff/koff-crisp-vaalea-lager)

I like this one quite a bit.  There is enough hops flavor and the flavor palatte seems well-balanced.
The quality-control of this beer is imperfet - I can detect variation between batches.
Some cans taste a bit metallic, while others are a bit skunkier than others.

### [More Brewing Lager](https://www.hartwall.fi/yritys/uutiset/2021/hartwallin-uusi-olutbrandi-more-brewing-on-alkoholittomana-syntynyt/)

This one is pretty good, but not as good as Crisp.
There is a lot of hops flavor in this one, but it seems like the beer is trying too hard to do this.
There are a lot of American alcoholic beers that try too hard to taste like hops, and if you like those beers, you will like this one.

### [Karjala](https://www.hartwall.fi/juomat/oluet/karjala/karjala-00/)

I do not like this one at all.
I do not understand what the creators were going for, but this is not a good beer.
There is not even a bad American beer -- e.g. Milwaukee's Best Ice -- that I can remember being worse.

### [Tsingtao Alcohol Free Lager](https://www.alko.fi/en/products/708554/Tsingtao-Alcohol-Free-Lager/)

This one was pretty good.
I can't remember Tsingtao well enough to know if it is an authentic reproduction of the flavor, but it tastes like a real beer.

### [Kukko Pils](https://laitilan.com/en/tuote/kukko-pils-alcohol-free/)

_Note: this one - like the others from Kukko - is 0.3%, not strictly 0.0%, so if a tiny amount of alcohol is a problem for you, avoid this one._

This one is okay.  I don't like Pilsner that much, but I think it's a reasonable approximation to a real pilsner.
