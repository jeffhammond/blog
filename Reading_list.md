[The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Making_of_the_Atomic_Bomb).

How Not to Network A Nation by Benjamin Peters.
I stopped reading this one because it was too slow.  The topic could be covered with far fewer words.

Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss.

[The Great Influenza by John M. Barry](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/288950/the-great-influenza-by-john-m-barry/).
I enjoyed this book a great deal.  The first third is about the development of modern medicine in the USA, not influenza specifically.

Abstracting Away the Machine by Lorenzo.

[Modern Fortran Explained: Incorporating Fortran 2018 by Michael Metcalf, John Reid, Malcolm Cohen](https://academic.oup.com/book/26799).
This is an excellent book on the topic.  If you are serious Fortran programmer, you should own it.

[Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511611230).
I did not want to read this book and didn't enjoy it, partly because of the writing and partly because of the subject matter.

A History of Finland by Henrik Meinander.

Finland's Relations with the Soviet Union, 1944-84 by R Allison.

The Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kidder.  (I guess I didn't finish this one)

Inside the Message Passing Interface by Supalov.

Cybernetics by Wiener.

[One Giant Leap by Charles Fishman](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/One-Giant-Leap/Charles-Fishman/9781501106309).
This is a great sociopolitical perspective on the Apollo Program.

[The Supermen by Charles J. Murray](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/The+Supermen:+The+Story+of+Seymour+Cray+and+the+Technical+Wizards+Behind+the+Supercomputer-p-9780471048855).

Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy.

The Decline and Fall of IBM by Robert X. Cringley.

Only the Paranoid Survive by Andy Grove.

The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayon Christensen.

Far from the Tree by Andrew Solomon.

The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood by James Gleick.

[The Media Lab by Steward Brand](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/the-media-lab-inventing-the-future-book/).
I love this book, because it's from 1986 and I can see how well they predicted things, 
like high-speed internet at home and mobile computing devices.

[Electrifying America by David Nye](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262140485/).
This one is probably too dry for most people, but I enjoyed it.
I stopped reading 80-90% of the way through, because it was pretty clear that the story was 
going to end with most Americans having electricity ðŸ˜Š

Working on the Bomb: An Oral History of WWII Hanford. By S. L. Sanger.
This was a gift when I left PNNL.  It's a great perspective on the Manhatten Project from a different perspective
than one gets from the Los Alamos centered works.

[The Puzzle Palace by James Bamford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Puzzle_Palace).

[The Nobel Prize by Burton Feldman](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Nobel-Prize/Burton-Feldman/9781611457247).

[Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_(book)).

[Blank Spots on the Map by Trevor Paglen](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/302310/blank-spots-on-the-map-by-trevor-paglen/).

[Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets by P. van der Linden](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/expert-c-programming/0131774298/).
It has been a while since I read this book, but I enjoyed it years ago.

Who Got Einstein's Office by Regis.

Genius by James Gleick.

Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh.

How Would You Move Mount Fuji by William Poundstone.
