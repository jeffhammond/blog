# Have Read

[The Media Lab by Steward Brand](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/the-media-lab-inventing-the-future-book/).
I love this book, because it's from 1986 and I can see how well they predicted things, 
like high-speed internet at home and mobile computing devices.

[Electrifying America by David Nye](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262140485/).
This one is probably too dry for most people, but I enjoyed it.
I stopped reading 80-90% of the way through, because it was pretty clear that the story was 
going to end with most Americans having electricity ðŸ˜Š

Working on the Bomb: An Oral History of WWII Hanford. By S. L. Sanger.
This was a gift when I left PNNL.  It's a great perspective on the Manhatten Project from a different perspective
than one gets from the Los Alamos centered works.

[One Giant Leap by Charles Fishman](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/One-Giant-Leap/Charles-Fishman/9781501106309).
This is a great sociopolitical perspective on the Apollo Program.

[The Puzzle Palace by James Bamford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Puzzle_Palace).

[The Nobel Prize by Burton Feldman](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Nobel-Prize/Burton-Feldman/9781611457247).

[Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_(book)).

[The Supermen by Charles J. Murray](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/The+Supermen:+The+Story+of+Seymour+Cray+and+the+Technical+Wizards+Behind+the+Supercomputer-p-9780471048855).

Ogilvy on Advertising by David Ogilvy.

[Blank Spots on the Map by Trevor Paglen](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/302310/blank-spots-on-the-map-by-trevor-paglen/).

[Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets by P. van der Linden](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/expert-c-programming/0131774298/).
It has been a while since I read this book, but I enjoyed it years ago.
