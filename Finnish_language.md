# The Finnish language

I've lived in Finland for approximately one year.
These are my thoughts on learning Finnish, based on my experience so far.

TL;DR You will not need to know any Finnish to survive in the Helsinki area, but it helps to know a few things.

# Basics

The two most important words in Finnish are kiitos (thank you) and anteeksi (excuse me).
If you can infer what people are saying from context,
you can get through a number of interactions with strangers using only "kiitos",
for example, grocery shopping.

When I want to work hard to communicate to a Finn that I want to speak English with them,
I say "voimmeko puhua englantia?" (can we speak English?).  If I am lazy, I just say, "sorry",
and they switch to English most of the time.

# Conversing with Finns

The average Finnish person speaks English very well, although they will always
underestimate their ability to do so (Finns are excessively modest).
In most cases, unless it is an explicit goal to use Finnish, 
it is more effective to just switch to English.
Switching back and forth between languages is difficult for most people, and will
often confuse the listener more than speaking one language they only partially understand.

If a Finn does not understand a word you use, it can be useful to replace it with a literal
description of what it is, since many Finnish words are created this way
([examples](https://becomingfinnishsite.wordpress.com/2018/08/13/funny-finnish-words-with-literal-translations/)).

# Hearing and Pronuncing Words

Finnish pronounciation is very straightforward - the language is perfectly phonetic - but
it's obviously not identical to any other language.
Pronunciation is more important in Finnish than in English, particularly since 
words that sound very similar can have very different meanings
(e.g. [tapan versus tapaan](https://www.finnishpod101.com/blog/2020/12/11/common-finnish-mistakes/)).

Unlike English, where one can be extremely casual about pronounciation and still be understood
by most proficient speakers, one should try to pronounce words correctly in Finnish
even if one does not understand the meaning.
For example, one should learn to pronounce one's address properly, for the purposes of providing
it to taxi drivers.

Note that the sound of one letter and two letters is meaningful, for both vowels and consonants,
as demonstrated above with tapan/tapaan.
You also need to pronounce double-t and double-k properly, 
since these are part of two different syllables.
For example, bank=pankki, which is pronounced pank-ki.
All of the school materials for kids learning Finnish hyphenates the words so they learn the
correct pronounciation.

# Spoken versus Written Finnish

The spoken language ("puhekieli") is usually a shorthand version of the
formal language ("kirjakieli").  The former is geographically dependent and
varies between, say, Helsinki and Pori.
If you speak kirjakieli, everyone will know you are a novice speaker, but
at least they will understand you.  I don't see any reason to try to figure out
puhekieli until you are at least a year into learning Finnish and live here.
I have not devoted any time to it, but my family tells me things.

If you are going to learn puhekieli to listen to others, the only parts I've managed
to learn so far are that mä=minä and sä=sinä (shorthand for first and second person
singular pronouns) and that numbers get shortened from, say, yksi to yks, which
is good because the written form of 99 is yhdeksänkymmentäyhdeksän, which makes for a
rather tedious singing of "99 bottles of beer on the wall"...

# Swearing and Rude Phrases

Just say "perkele" (Devil).  It's the universal swear word when things go wrong.
The harder you roll your Rs, the more you mean it.

There is no reason to learn how to say rude things to people in Finland, because
everyone is helpful.  If you want to be rude to someone, say
"äitisi oli hamsteri ja isäsi haisi seljanmarjoilta."

Most references to "saunan takana" (behind the sauna) are death threats, although
it is unlikely the usage will be serious enough to warrant action by the listener.
I'm only familiar with its use in jest or when Finns are being abusive to one another on the internet
(since Facebook doesn't understand this colloquialism, it is not recognized as a Terms of Service violation).

# DuoLingo

Lots of people on the internet like to criticize DuoLingo.
I have found it very useful, and it is certainly better than nothing.
Unfortunately, the Finnish course is rather short relative to German, for example,
and it does not cover critical topics like the days of the week or months of the year.
On the other hand, it is good for practicing a bunch of basic concepts, such as
ordering food at a restaurant and describing the elements of nature.

I finished the DuoLingo Finnish course and can understand about a third of the words
that I hear spoken in public, and be able to hear most of the others well enough that
I can look them up in a dictionary.

Given that finding Finnish language education outside of Finland is quite difficult,
if you are planning to come to Finland for a nontrivial period of time, I recommend that 
you devote some time to DuoLingo Finnish.

# Google Translate

Google Translate for Finnish is far from perfect.
It knows very little about homonyms, and will falsely lead you to believe that
you are eating varnish-flavored quark, because "lakka" means both varnish and cloudberry.
You will also have to figure out from context whether something is a cucumber or a throat
(both are "kurkku").
On the other hand, it can translate from images, which is incredible useful when one 
receives a form letter or a parking ticket.

# Online Resources

These are online resources I find useful:

There are many other good resources, particularly from universities.
If you are serious about learning Finnish, you'll search for these online and find them easily enough.
