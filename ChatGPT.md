Q: Please write a code that transposes a matrix of arbitrary size using CUDA Fortran

A: Here is an example of a Fortran program that transposes a matrix of arbitrary size using CUDA:

```fortran
program matrix_transpose
  use cudafor
  implicit none

  ! Declare variables
  integer, parameter :: m = 1000, n = 1000
  real, dimension(m,n) :: a, b
  integer :: i, j

  ! Initialize input matrix
  do i = 1, m
    do j = 1, n
      a(i,j) = i * j
    end do
  end do

  ! Transfer input matrix to device
  a = a !$cuf

  ! Launch kernel to transpose matrix on device
  call transpose_matrix(m, n, a, b)

  ! Transfer result back to host
  b = b !$cuf

  ! Print transposed matrix
  do i = 1, m
    do j = 1, n
      write(*,*) b(i,j)
    end do
  end do

end program matrix_transpose

! Kernel to transpose matrix on device
attributes(global) subroutine transpose_matrix(m, n, a, b)
  implicit none

  ! Declare variables
  integer, value :: m, n
  real, dimension(m,n) :: a, b
  integer :: i, j

  ! Get thread and block indices
  i = blockIdx%x
  j = threadIdx%x

  ! Compute transposed matrix element
  b(i,j) = a(j,i)

end subroutine transpose_matrix
```
This program defines a matrix_transpose program that initializes an input matrix on the host, transfers it to the device, launches a kernel to transpose the matrix on the device, and then transfers the result back to the host to be printed to the screen. The transpose_matrix kernel uses the thread and block indices to compute the transposed matrix element at the corresponding position in the output matrix. The size of the matrix can be changed by modifying the m and n parameters. Note that this is just one possible way to implement matrix transposition using CUDA Fortran, and there are many other ways to achieve the same result.
