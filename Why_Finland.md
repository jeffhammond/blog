# Why Finland?

This is a question I get asked quite a bit, and it is overdue for me to write about it.
This will be a long post, and probably have quite a few iterations before it is finished.

I will answer the questions of why I decided to leave the USA and why I did not choose
to live in other countries in separate posts, so if you are looking for that here,
you will be disappointed.

# Finland is a great place for children

The juvenile education system is highly regarded.
I will not try to restate what is well-covered
[elsewhere](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/10-reasons-why-finlands-education-system-is-the-best-in-the-world).

Finns do not pay for education in Finland.  Ever.
[Only students from outside the EU, EEA and Switzerland pay tuition](https://www.study.eu/article/tuition-fees-in-finland).
This is one of many reasons why it is reasonable to pay higher taxes.
Rather than save up hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to give it to a private university
with a multi-billion dollar endowment in the USA, or a nominally "public" institution
with slightly lower fees (between $20K and $40K a year at present), I can pay my taxes,
apply for citizenship, and send my kids to top universities for less than the cost of a bus pass.

Even those who pay tuition pay far less than they would in the USA.
The maximum tuition rate in Finland is Helsinki University, at
â‚¬18K/year, which is not too much more than a state resident pays for
[UMass](https://www.massachusetts.edu/education/tuition-fees)
and about half of what an out-of-state domestic student pays at
[UCLA](https://admission.ucla.edu/tuition-aid/tuition-fees).

# Finland does not treat people like garbage

Finland also considers homelessness unacceptable and has policies to eliminate it
(https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness).
This is in stark contrast to the USA, which has a
[homeless population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States)
on par with Helsinki or Portland, Oregon.

Police in Finland [rarely draw their guns](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/police_in_finland_shoot_their_firearms_in_the_line_of_duty_about_ten_times_each_year/10183865)
and frequently [kill no one for an entire year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_by_country#2010s).

The Finnish prison system actually attempts to [rehabilitate](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/open_prisons_in_finland_are_like_a_holiday_camp__but_they_seem_to_work/11214953) people.
