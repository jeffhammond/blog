# About this project

This is my blog.  I did not feel like learning a new system and I like GitHub a lot, so I figured I could just add my writing here and people could figure out how to read it if they want.

## Permissions

I assert copyright on all of my original content here.  I don't see why anyone would want to reuse my material as their own, but if you want to publish something I've created elsewhere, please request permission via a GitHub issue.

# About me

I am a nerd.  I have a life outside of work that revolves around my family, which I do not discuss in detail online.
